The Medicare app is an app which is planned to provide various features like- 
reminding the patient about his or her medication time,tracking the time of pregnant woman,
getting appointment with doctor,providing health related suggestions etc.But due to unavoidable circumstances we
were not been able to complete the full functional app.It only  gives the medication reminder now.
But we do have a plan to implement the full app in near future.
