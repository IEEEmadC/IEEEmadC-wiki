Short Description : If you needed some favour from any one in your locality then you don't need to go from home to home but simple search for it on the app.
Team : Entwickler
Description : 
    I am here and I need help features in the app are designed to ensure personal safety and are easily accessible
    I am Here service lets family and friends of the user track his/her location
    In case of receiving any panic alert via SMS from the user’s number, they will be able to track the exact location.
    I need Help service raises an alarm in crisis situations and simultaneously sends alerts to family and friends
    When an individual defines a closed user group (CUG), everyone in the group gets a series of educational messages to know why they get panic messages and how they can react to save their friend in crisis situations.
    When the panic button is pressed an SMS is sent out to the selected CUG – “Help me. I am in danger”.
    Once the user activates the alarm service, the device immediately sends out a Dramatic Alarm and periodically sends the user’s update to them
